# Pet Store OOP

Instruction: 
-----------

Create a project in IntelliJ called AnimalApplication.

Create a Animal class that allows for Animal name, type , description, price and isInStock variables

The ABSTRACT Animal class shall contain private member variables, a default constructor, an overloaded constructor and an abstract method called getPet() which returns a String with the animal name, type and description.


Create at least two classes that inherit from the Animal class.

The application shall also contain getters and setters for each private member variable.

Create another class called AnimalApp which contains the main method. In the main method you shall create at least 3 instances of classes that inherit the Animal abstract class. Use User input to set the private member variables.   Save user entry in a collection and print the Animal name, Animal Type and Description.

All I/O (input/output) should be done in the main method!!
